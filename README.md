## About

In March 2023, I decided to take a year-long break from work to focus on independent learning. During this break, I spent most of my time reading, practising and studying topics in mathematics (mostly related to 3D computer graphics), functional programming, database internals, and computer architecture.

At the start of 2024, to prepare for my return to work, I decided to brush up on my web development skills and complete a small portfolio project. During this period, I completed [Josh Comeau's CSS-for-JS course](https://css-for-js.dev/) and spent time learning modern React. I then spent the next few months (March-May) working part-time on this project.
